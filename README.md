# ðŸ¤– AI Content Creator

## Overview

The AI Content Creator is a web application built with LangChain and Streamlit that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality written content. Users can choose to create full-length blog posts or catchy YouTube video titles on any given topic.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental LangChain concepts, including:
- Prompt Engineering and `PromptTemplate`
- Creating and managing `LLMChain`s
- Using `OutputParsers` for structured data extraction
- Building interactive user interfaces for AI applications with Streamlit.
